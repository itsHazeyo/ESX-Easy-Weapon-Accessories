# ESX Weapon Components
weapon components for esx


[INSTALLATION]


1) Import items from esx_weapcomponents.sql into your database
2) Add this in your server.cfg :

```
start esx_weapcomponents (or rename it, it doesn't effect anything.)
```

3) Enjoy!. 

This script is a modified version of easy_weapon_accessories_v1/Eden_Accessories, I added component_ to the SQL item name making it possible to enable more attachments, enabled give back function if attachment doesn't fit your weapon, made weapon list easier to read and added more weapons.

Any problems let me know.
